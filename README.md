# About
This repo contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and concepts all 
heavily commented with intuitive and personified explanations. The goal is to understand 
machine learning as a collection of new techniques that are more humanly reasonable (software 2.0) rather than a black box
of linear algebra and calculus.
